**When using 0.2mm-30deg v-bit, it was noted that:**
 * For small track widths and clearances (less than or equal to 1mm), a small depth is required (as per the equation:), and as small depths won't be actually cut into the cupper unless the level map was of a high resolution. Best results for 0.5mm track width were obtained at: 1mm/sample grid, 0.2mm depth.

 * For larger track widths and clearances, a relatively large depth is preferred, as it has no side effects and gives the ability of using low resolution level map. Best results for 2mm track width were obtained at: 10mm/sample grid, 0.5mm depth.

 * For less error in samples, use a small milling bit (~0.1mm) for sampling.
