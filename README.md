# 1. Introduction
This SW runs CNC milling and drilling machine by G-Code interfacing*.
(not all G-code methods are implemented, only the needed ones)

# 2. Target
Mainly targeted for STM32F103 MCU.

# 3. Features:
Each of the following will be discussed later.
  * Color LCD UI. (TODO)
  * Running G-code from SD-card.
  * Auto-Leveling.
  * Real-time paths simulation on MATLAB.
  * Spindle speed PID control.  (TODO)
  * Slef homing.  (TODO)
  * Z-axis fault handling.  (TODO)
  * Continue after pwoer-loss.  (TODO)
