  Even though it may not be the best program among likes - hahaha - but I've learned and gained a quantity that I
  myself am compensated with, hoping it would improve my skills, looking forward for the best and for never stopping
  the process of learning, trying, making mistakes, debugging, optimizing, and agile-ing over.

  Thanks to every single person helped me in this project, technically or emotionally, demonstrating principles,
  sharing previous experiences, providing hardware material, or much more that I may not even recall.
  -	Family.                 For their patience and taking over a lot off me.
  -	Assiut Robotics team.   For proving - nearly most of - hardware material and workspace.
  -	Ahmed Osama.            (teaching assistant at electronics and communication department, faculty of
                            engineering, Assiut university). For his guidance, supervision, and most importantly:
                            encouragement.
  -	Eslam Wael.             (colleague student). Mechanical engineer.
  -	Mohammed Mahmoud Abdo.  (colleague student). For all the time we spent brainstorming and discussing methods.
  -	Tarek M. Medhat.        (colleague student). Physical user interface.
  -	Ahmed Abdul-Baset.      (colleague student). PCB designer.
